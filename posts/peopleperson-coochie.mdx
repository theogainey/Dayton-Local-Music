Over the past year, there has been a number of great releases from the label, Overthought Musik. From the Tymb Richard's single ["Concrete Ship"](https://tymbrichards.bandcamp.com) to the full-length album *Overthought Musik*, nearly every release can be included among some of Dayton's best. Now with the February 28th of *Coochie* by Peopleperson, there is one more great release joining that list.

Additionally, Coochie is the fourth release from Peopleperson since 2016. Featuring the surf-rock guitar styling of D Robbins, this 4 song EP is a fun and quick listen. In fact, the EP clocks in at only 12 minutes so there is no reason not to give it a listen. While the EP is a short one, it's still long enough to make an enjoyable listening experience.
