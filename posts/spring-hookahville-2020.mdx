Since it's founding in 1994, the long-running annual event Hookahville has grown to become one of Ohio's premier music festivals. After many successful festivals, Hookahville will be returning to the Brushy Fork Phamily Ranch this May. Although there are many reasons to be excited about this festival, perhaps the biggest reason is the extremely talented lineup. In fact, this year's lineup includes two bands from the Dayton area.

First of the two Dayton area bands featured in the lineup is the Psychedelic rock powerhouse [The Werks](https://www.facebook.com/thewerksmusic/). Significant about the inclusion of The Werks in the lineup is the fact that the band has recently cut back on live performances. In particular, the band has recently announced the cancelation of the 2020 edition of their annual [Werkout Festival](https://liveforlivemusic.com/news/the-werks-the-werk-out-hiatus/). On the other hand, those reasons make their inclusion in the lineup so much more exciting.

In addition to The Werks, also apart of this year's lineup is the Dayton area bluegrass band, [Stringus Khan](https://www.facebook.com/stringuskhan/). Despite being a newer name to the Dayton music scene this band has already gained a lot of attention. For instance, the band just recently completed a successful crowdfunding campaign to fund their debut album, Colorado Speedbump. Set to be released on March 13th anyone who is a fan of bluegrass should be excited about the upcoming album.
