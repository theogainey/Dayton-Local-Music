Since their founding in 2016, This Pine Box already has accomplished a lot as a band. In less than four years of being active, the band has already released many excellent tracks and has played many impressive shows. In fact, the band even played at the 2018 Bellwether Music Festival's Saturday night afterparty. But most recently on January 9th, the band released a new single titled "How We Roll".

There are many reasons why both fans and those new to the band will love "How We Roll". Significantly this track was the first time the band took a do-it-yourself approach to song recording. In this case "How We Roll" was recorded on a tape machine in a basement and produced by John Curley of [The Afghan Whigs](https://www.facebook.com/TheAfghanWhigsOfficial/). Furthermore, "How We Roll" is a song many listeners will find easy to relate to. Specifically, this song is all about someone having a hard time finding their place and feeling at home.

In addition to kicking off 2020 by releasing "How We Roll", This Pine Box has big plans for the year. Especially when it comes to releasing new music, 2020 is going to be a meaningful year for the band. Not only are they planning on releasing a new single each month but also they are gearing up to release a new album in the fall. If you can't wait to hear more from this great band you can check them out this Friday(1/17) at MOTR in Cincinnati and Saturday(1/18) at Blind Bob's in Dayton's Historic Oregon District.
