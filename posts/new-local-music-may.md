Even though Dayton, Ohio hasn't seen live music in a while, local musicians are still hard at work. In fact, the first two weeks of May have been an amazing two weeks for new music. For this reason, we are very excited to share these great new releases from local musicians with you.

## TINO - PAST DUE

First up on our list is the latest EP from [TINO](http://itstino.com/), *Past Due*. Even though TINO has released plenty of new music since then, this EP is a follow up to his 2013 EP Friendly Reminder. While it has only been two weeks since it's release, Past Due has already received an overwhelmingly positive reception. In fact, many of his fans are already considering it some of the best Hip-Hop to come out of Dayton recently. If you at all consider yourself a fan of the genre be sure to head on over to TINO's [Bandcamp](https://hiphoptino.bandcamp.com/) page and give it a listen.

## The Pullouts - "If I Fall"

Although [The Pullouts](https://www.thepullouts.com/) have not released any new music in about three years, on May 8th the band finally broke that streak by releasing the new single "If I Fall". For fans of the band, you will not be disappointed by this long-overdue new music. Additionally, for those new to the band "If I Fall" is a great example of what the band is all about. Specifically, "If I Fall" is a great example of the band's approach to fronting a rock band with a piano. So new fan or old be sure to head over to Spotify and check it out. In the event that this single isn't enough for you, no need to worry as the band is releasing a new EP, titled *Tumbleweed Waltz*, in June.

## Viceroy Kings - *Drunken Alibis*

Another local band that has released some great new music in the first half of may is [Viceroy Kings](https://www.facebook.com/ViceroyKings). On May 1st the band released their latest EP, Drunken Alibis. Notably what we like most about his EP is it's just some good old fashioned rock. Consisting of just 3 songs, Drunk Alibis is the perfect EP if you are looking to rock out real quick with some great locally made music. Additionally, the EP is available for purchase on [Bandcamp](https://viceroykings.bandcamp.com/album/drunken-alibis) and can be streamed on most major streaming services.

## Seth Canan - "Keep Some Light"

Next up on our list is Seth Canan's new single, "Keep Some Light". In addition to being released on May 5th, this new song and it's B side "Nothing Here Now" were both self-produced by Seth Canan. If you are not yet familiar with Seth Canan, he has been around the Dayton music scene for a few years, playing with his band Seth Canan & The Carriers. Even with their album, *Strange Forces*, being one of our favorite albums of 2019, this new single maybe some of his best work yet. Be sure to keep an eye on Seth's music because his future as a musician is bright. While not yet available on major streaming platforms you can listen to this new single by [clicking here](https://sethcanan.hearnow.com/).
