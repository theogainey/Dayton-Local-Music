Dayton Porchfest will be returning to Dayton's historic on August 22nd, 2020. Since 2017, Dayton Porchfest has taken place annually in Dayton's St. Anne's Hill neighborhood. With last year's Porchfest featuring 50 musical acts, many are excited to see what this year will bring. Likewise, musicians wanting to perform at this year's event can do so until March 16th.

For those wanting to perform, applications are open to musicians of any genre. In fact, Dayton Porchfest planners see musical diversity as a key to the event's success. Last year's event saw a wide variety of performers so do not be afraid to apply no matter what genre of music you play.
