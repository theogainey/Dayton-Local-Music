Years from now when Local Music Day is a long-established event many will wonder how it got its start. Perhaps the best way to explain how is to look at *Album* from [Overthought Musik](https://overthoughtmusik.com). In fact, if it wasn't for *Album* there most likely would be no Local Music Day. The reason is that the idea for Local Music Day came from wanting to promote *Album* in a way that also celebrates the best of Dayton. In addition to being the initial point of inspiration for Local Music Day, there are many great things about *Album*

Comprising of eight songs featuring eight different singers, this unique project from D Robbins brings some of Dayton's best together. Apart from being some of the best work D Robbins has done, Album is sure to introduce listeners to many great musicians. With each song having its own individual feel it's near impossible to pick any standout songs. Ask eight different people what their favorite song was and chances are you will get eight different answers. That is the reason why *Album* from Overthough Musik is so good, it has variety without sacrificing any quality.

Both those already familiar with Dayton's music scene and those who are not, need to listen to *Album*. Overthought Musik has put together a work that is simultaneous an excellent example of why Dayton's music scene is so special and a sample of different local talents. If you still haven't realized that Dayton's music scene is something special now is the time to get on board.
