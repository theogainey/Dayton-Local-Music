On January 31st, the Yellow Springs, OH-based band Speaking Suns released their newest album *Terrestrial Year*. Since Speaking Sun's 2014 debut full-length album, Vanishing Country, the band has grown to become one of Yellow Springs's most popular groups. In addition to a continually expanding fanbase, the band has also performed at many high-profile events including the 2018 Bellwether Music Festival. As a result, the band has developed a presence that expands beyond the Dayton music scene.

Similar to their growing fanbase, Speaking Suns drew upon resources beyond Dayton to record and release *Terrestrial Year*. In fact, the band chose to record the album at Treehouse Records' recording studio in Chicago Illinois. Additionally, the band celebrated the album's release with a show at Columbus Ohio's Rumba Cafe. Ultimately *Terrestrial Year* is already proving to be a big step forward for the band.

If you are not already a fan of Speaking Suns, there is no better time than now to check them out. In addition to the band expanding beyond the Dayton music scene, *Terrestrial Year* is some of their best work to date. A perfect example of this is the music video the band released for the song "From Nowhere". In this video, it can be clearly seen just how good the band has become.
