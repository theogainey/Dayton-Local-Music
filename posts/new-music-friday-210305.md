After kicking off his year by releasing the single "Wake Up Brother", Andrew Gabbard released yet another new single. Titled "Instant Trancer" and released on February 23, it is the second single off his upcoming LP *Homemade Album*. One of the many things to love about this song is how personal this song is. In fact, Andrew wrote this song as an ode to his daughter. Right now, you can find "Instant Trancer "on Andrew Gabbard's [Bandcamp page](https://andrewgabbard.bandcamp.com/track/wake-up-brother) and major streaming services.

Although [Freight](https://www.freighttheband.com/) hasn’t around the Dayton music scene for very long, the band has still managed to release a lot of quality original music.

Last up on our list of new music from Dayton area musicians is the new album from [The Boxcar Suite](https://www.theboxcarsuite.com/). Originally this album, titled *Every Side of the Abyss*, was planned for a fall 2020 release but because of the pandemic, the band decided to delay its release. Now after the delay, the band finally released the album on March 5th. Among the many reasons to love this new album is that it features some of the last recordings guitarist Tony Moore made with the band before moving out of the country. Currently, *Every Side of the Abyss* can be found on major streaming services and is available for purchase on The Boxcar Suite’s [Bandcamp page](https://theboxcarsuite.bandcamp.com/album/every-side-of-the-abyss).
