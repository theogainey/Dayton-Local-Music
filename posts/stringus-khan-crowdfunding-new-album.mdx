In order to release their first album, Stringus Khan, a fast-growing bluegrass project from Dayton, Ohio, is raising money on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. Titled *Colorado Speedbump* and set for release on March 13th, this project has until January 30th to reach its funding goal.

Founded by Ben Clonch and Max Nunery, Stringus Khan has been around since the summer of 2018. Since then the band has played shows at some of Dayton, Cincinnati, and Columbus Ohio's best venues for up-and-coming artists. Together with Ben Clonch (Guitar/Vocals), the band's current lineup includes Rob Spahr (Bass/Vocals), Jenny Walker (Vocals), Kevin Cretsos (Banjo), Evan Lane (Mandolin/ Dobro), and Robbie Marion (Fiddle). Although Max Nunery is no longer a member he still remains a close friend of the band.

While still a few months from release there are many reasons to be excited for *Colorado Speedbump*. In the first place, a band's first album is always something to be excited about. In addition, the band is also brought in two Grammy award winners to help record the album. The first of the two is [Jeremy Garrett](https://www.garrettgrass.com/) of Grammy award-winning The [Infamous String Dusters](https://www.facebook.com/thestringdusters/) who produced the album. Furthermore, the album was mastered by Grammy winner [David Glaser](https://airshowmastering.com/david-glasser/). For those not familiar with David Glaser, he has mastered an impressive catalog of albums. Some of his notable credits include mastering albums from the Grateful Dead, Yonder Mountain String Band, and more.
