Following a string of great releases, the local trio Starving in the Belly of the Whale is set to release A Memory. With A Memory, the trio brings a concept not often seen to their third release. Although the album is just one album each side brings its own unique composition to make A Memory: Preserved and Forgotten. Made up of Ricky Terrell on Guitar and vocals, Lacey Terrell on theremin, percussion, and vocals, and Scott Loy on the cello, saw, and vocals, Starving in the Belly of the Whale has once again recorded an excellent album.

Embracing the resurgence in popularity of the vinyl format, Starving in the Belly of the Whale presents a separate story on each side of the album. With one side of the album being A Memory: Preserved and the other A Memory: Forgotten, the trio has created an album in a way that is not often seen. As each song clearly fills a purpose, one will find it difficult to pick favorite songs or even a favorite side. With that being said, some notable standouts include "Ghost Story" and "Want to Know". Those who listen to the album will find that each side plays as if it is its own unique album while simultaneously finding that both sides flow seamlessly together.

With A Memory, Starving in the Belly of the Whale once again shows that they are among the best of Dayton's local musicians. By recording A Memory the way they did the trio not just demonstrates their musical talents but also the fact that they excel at telling a story. With A Memory, fans of both the band and vinyl alike will not be disappointed.
