As a complex of three industrial-sized buildings, there is no better place to check out local art than [Front Street](https://www.frontstreet.art/home.html). Although The Front Street complex is open 7 days a week, individual artists host their own hours, the best way to experience Front Street is their three monthly events. The first, and most notable of these is their monthly First Friday event. This March their First Friday event will take place on March 6th from 5 -9 pm. In addition to the art galleries being open, this event will also feature live music from Jerry & Vaugh Live. If you can't make this month's First Friday be sure to check out their Second Look Saturday and Third Sunday events.
