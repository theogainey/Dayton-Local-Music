On August 22nd, Dayton area musician Matt Witzeman released a new solo album, *Flying On The Astral Plane*. Although still largely unknown in the Dayton area music scene, this album is Matt's second full-length solo album. As a self-proclaimed "alt singer-songwriter" Matt chose to take an approach that embraced the one-man-band aspect of his style when it came to writing and recording this new album. In addition to his one-man-band style, Matt also recorded and produced the album himself, making *Flying On The Astral* Plane a truly D.I.Y. album.

Perhaps one of the more interesting aspects of *Flying On The Astral Plane* is that in several of his songs Matt pays tribute to some of his favorite films and television shows. For instance, the song "Hell is a Hotel" pays tribute to the HBO show *The Leftovers*, while the song "Fear and Hope" comes from his love for *The Shawshank Redemption*. While a few songs on the album are also influenced by pop culture, the song he is most proud of, "The Doppler Effect", does not. Instead, "The Doppler Effect" takes influence from his science and engineering background and blends those themes with more deeply creative elements.

While Matt Weitzman has been writing and recording music for a while now, his music has taken a back seat over the last couple of years. That is until the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic when Matt saw the extra time at home as a great opportunity to get back to writing and recording music. Additionally while writing and recording this album Matt also used the time to improve upon his recording skills, paying more attention to the production quality and the fullness of sound than he did with his previous work. As a result, Matt hopes to build off the album and use the coming year to be much more active in Dayton's music scene. According to Matt, "With the album out, I hope to return to the performance scene in 2021. I want to really be active in the music scene across Dayton, and I hope venues will give me the chance to share my craft."
