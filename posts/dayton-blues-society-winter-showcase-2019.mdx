Opening for Teeny Tuck is Dayton Blues Society "Road To Memphis" winners Jimmy Roger(solo) and [Ralph & The Rythm Hounds(band)](https://www.facebook.com/RalphandTheRhythmHounds). As the last of the Dayton Blues Society's annual events, this will be the last time in 2019 to see what they are all about.

Hosing several annual events in the Dayton area, the Dayton Blues Society's mission is to promote blues in the area. Admission to this event consists of donations at the door and attending is an excellent way to support the society. Not only is attending a great way to support local music but also a great opportunity to see what blues music is all about.
