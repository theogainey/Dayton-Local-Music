Dayton Sideshow returns to Yellow Cab Tavern for its 15th anniversary on Friday and Saturday, May 22 & 23.

Artists, Musicians, and Performers gather at Dayton’s largest all-volunteer music and art show for this all-ages showcase of the community.

A two-day showcase of some of Dayton and the Miami Valleys’ top artists, performers, and a mixture of all genres from the music scene providing a soundtrack for this exciting event in the Gem City.

We welcome and encourage all citizens to volunteer. This is a great way to network and join the community.

Artists and performers will be required to help volunteer, applications are due by Midnight March 1, 2020.

“This is my favorite event of the year in Dayton, it brings people of all ages out for a show. I’ve seen countless bands I didn’t know about that later became guests on the podcast” - Terry "IzzyRock" Martin host of Gem City Podcast
