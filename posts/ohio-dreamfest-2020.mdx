In order to help out those in need, organizers of Ohio Dreamfest are helping some music fans going through a hard time to make it to this year's festival. Specifically, festival organizers will be giving out 42 free or "miracle" tickets to fans who need it the most. To make this happen, Ohio Dreamfest wants you to nominate someone you believe is deserving of a free ticket.

For many music fans attending a music festival can be an uplifting experience. But unfortunately, costs often prevent some of those who need it most from going. For this reason, Ohio Dreamfest's organizers are giving out "miracle" tickets in the form of guest list spots to some fans who can't afford to attend this year's festival.

Instead of choosing random fans, the "miracle" tickets will be going those deemed most deserving. If you know someone you feel would benefit from receiving a "miracle" ticket and is deserving you are encouraged to nominate them. You can do so by sending an email with your name and the name of your nominee and why you think they are deserving to 623main@gmail.com. Additionally, organizers are asking you to like the festival's page on Facebook.

Furthermore, free tickets of this nature are commonly known as "miracle" tickets in the jam band/psychedelic rock community. Notably, the use of the term "miracle" ticket was first popularized by fans of The Grateful Dead. Adopting the term from the song "I Need a Miracle", ticketless fans holding up signs reading "I Need A Miracle" became a common sight outside the band's concerts following the song's 1978 release. To this day ticketless fans hoping for a "miracle" can be found outside concerts of the band's current form(Dead & Company).

## More About Ohio Dreamfest
Ohio Dreamfest was founded by members of the Greenville, Oh based band, Dustin Smith and The Daydreamers in 2017. Since then the festival has expanded from humble beginnings as a one-night eight-band mini-festival to a full-scale weekend festival. As a result of this growth, the lineup for this year's festival is the most impressive yet. In addition to Dustin Smith and The Daydreamers, the festival will also be headlined by Bumpin Uglies and Ekoostik Hookah.

Additionally, this year’s festival will be taking place in Ansonia, OH from June 18th - 21st. For those who wish to learn more about Ohio Dreamfest, you can check out the event’s [website](https://www.ohiodreamfest.com/). Additionally, tickets are available for purchase on Eventbrite.
