As part of the upcoming Local Music Day, many local musicians are releasing new music. One of the notable upcoming releases includes *Defacing the Moon*, a split album by [Mike Bankhead](https://www.facebook.com/MikeBankheadMusic) and [The Paint Splats](https://www.facebook.com/thepaintsplats). Although the two may have different styles of songwriting this album is one local music fans should be excited about. Including five songs from Mike Bankhead and three from The Paint Splats, *Defacing the Moon* has no shortage of great songs.

Featuring a diverse selection of songs, *Defacing the Moon* is an excellent way to check out two great local artists. For example, The Paint Splats' song "High on Paint Fumes" is a perfect example of what to expect from this artist in the future. In addition, Mike Bankhead shows off his wide range of talent with his tracks on the album. With the song "Pauline", listeners get a chance to experience how Mike Bankhead can not just write a great song in English but French too. Few, if not no other Dayton musician can pull off an album with songs in both English and French.

Altogether *Defacing the Moon* is an excellent album to exposure yourself to two talented Dayton musicians. Each one of the eight songs on the album gives listeners a good insight into what these two are about. Everyone, already a fan of Dayton's local musicians or not, needs to give these two artists a listen.
