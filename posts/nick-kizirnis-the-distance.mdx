After seven years since his last solo album, Nick Kizirnis has released *The Distance* on February 1st. In the time since his last solo album, he has not limited his music to just one genre. Playing everything from indie rock to instrumental surf to rockabilly there is no doubt in his ability to successfully cross genres. Even though he has done a lot, Nick Kizirnis is best known locally for his work in [Nicky Kay Orchestra](https://www.facebook.com/NickyKayOrchestra/) and [The Mulchmen](https://www.facebook.com/mulchmen/).

In order to fill out the lineup for this solo album, Nick Kizirnis enlisted an extremely talented ensemble of musicians. In addition to his lead guitar, Nick Kizirnis is joined by Kate Wakefield ([Lung](https://www.facebook.com/lungtheband/)) on vocals, Tod Weidner ([Shrug](https://www.facebook.com/shrugd8n/) & [Motel Beds](https://www.facebook.com/motelbeds/)) on guitar, Mark Patterson ([Son Volt](https://www.facebook.com/SonVolt/)) on drums, Patrick Himes([Reel Love Recording](https://www.facebook.com/reelloverecording/)) on bass and keyboard, and "Crazy Joe‚Äù Tritschler on guitar. Together these musicians create one of the most talented lineups ever to record an album in the Dayton area.

If you are already a fan of Nick Kizirnis's work, *The Distance* will further seal your love for his work. The star-studded line up that joined him on the album has proved to be a match made in heaven. Coupled with excellent songwriting there is little room to imagine how the album could be better. Ultimately, The Distance is his best work to date.

Additionally, promotion for the album started on January 8th with the release of a music video for "Slipping Away". Directed by Sam Manavis, this video serves as an excellent preview of what to expect on the album.
