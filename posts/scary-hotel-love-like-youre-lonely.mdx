On November 9th, [Scary Hotel](https://www.facebook.com/scaryhotel/) released their first full-length album, *Love Like You're Lonely*. Also on November 9th, the band celebrated this release with an album release show at Blind Bob's. Made up of Mikey Chappell on vocals & guitar, Eric Dino on guitar & vocal, bassist Curt Estridge, Logan Briann on keyboard & vocals, and drummer Sean Duley, Scary Hotel have sealed themselves as a must-listen Dayton band with this release.

Every band has its own songwriting process and in the case of Scary Hotel, their's relies heavily on Mikey's experiences since moving to Dayton. In the case of *Love Like You're Lonely*, Mikey wrote songs to document a relationship he had when he first moved to Dayton. After Mikey pieced together the bare bones of the songs, the rest of the band went to work finishing the song so that his experiences could be shared in a relatable way.

On *Love Like You're Lonely* listeners will find ten songs that showcase the band's artistic and melancholy rock. Made up of 10 songs, each song relates to a specific personal memory from songwriter Mikey Chappell. As a result, each song will have a different effect on every listener. Even with that being the case there are a few songs that stand out on the album. Most notably is "Strange Hands", which is an excellent example of everything the band does well.

Those wanting to check out this great new album can find it on every major stream service. Also for those wanting to get a first-hand look at the band, the band has an upcoming show at South Park Tavern on December 7th.
