Fans of Dayton’s hip hop scene have more to look forward to than just Black Friday on November 29th. Local artist K. Carter will be releasing his third album, *NBX*, otherwise known as NerdBoy Extraordinaire. This fifteen track project follows his debut album, *Revenge of the Nerd*, and May 2018 release, *Rhythm And Poetry (R.A.P.)*. NBX incorporates much of the same boom-bap style that K. Carter has drawn from in the past, and features producers Dre Manuel and Bigg Makk, along with fellow artists Atlas, Geechi Gotti, Vanae, Valerie, and Eman Jones.

*NBX* feels like a triumphant shift from previous struggles and anxieties to a life of confidence that holds a strong sense of direction. This can be felt in the middle of the opening title track, where the beat shifts and allows fans to differentiate where K. Carter has come from as opposed to where he is going. He encourages others to pursue happiness and to be themselves - it’s clear throughout the album that K. Carter is in a comfort zone with his craft and doesn’t give any attention to what others may have to say.

K. Carter explained that he was able to be very open and have more fun on this album than with his previous work. “The inspiration for this one came from me being more comfortable with who I am as an artist, as a black man, and as a human being… I want (listeners) to open their minds and hearts for this album, and listen to the words because they are inspirational and also fun… underneath a lot of the songs are powerful messages that we all need from time to time.”

## How To Listen
*NBX* will be available on all streaming platforms on November 29th, so make sure you listen all the way through while you’re Black Friday shopping!

K. Carter will be performing at SIDEKIXMAS on December 13th at Blind Bobs - 100% of the door will go to Dayton Children’s Hospital. Fans can keep up with the Life and Times of K.
