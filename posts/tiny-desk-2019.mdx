Started in 2015, NPR has annually held a contest giving musicians across America a chance to be featured on their wildly popular web series, Tiny Desk Concerts. Started in 2008, NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts are a web series where musicians record an intimate performance at the desk of All Thing Considered's host Bob Boilen. Since the inception of the Tiny Desk Concerts, the web series has featured more than 800 performances and reached over 2 billion views on youtube. With the chance for widespread recognition on the line many artists, including several from the Dayton area, entered this year's contest.

This year the artists from the Dayton area included many great submissions. Folk duo The **Nautical Theme** not only entered with their original "Not Really Sure", but also took the opportunity to record an entire playlist in front of their tiny desk set up.

Among other great submissions was local **Paige Beller**, who's submission highlighted her many musical talents. In her submission "Failed Attempts and Cigarettes," Paige Beller displayed her many musical talents by not just providing excellent vocals but by also playing the keyboard with one hand and the drums with the other.
