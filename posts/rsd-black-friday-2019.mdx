The day after Thanksgiving, more commonly known as Black Friday, is annually the biggest shopping day of the year. While large retailers may feature stunning deals on big-ticket items it is important to remember that local stores also rely on Black Friday sales. Because of the importance of Black Friday shopping the organizers of the yearly event, Record Store Day, have made sure independent record stores have exclusive releases for the day. Likewise, music fans will be able to find some great deals and rare finds at local record stores this Black Friday.

## Omega Music

Located in the heart of the Oregon District, Omega Music is always a must-visit on Black Friday. In addition to having a large amount of exclusive Record Store Day Black Friday releases, Omega Music has much more to offer. As part of their Black Friday sales, the store is offing $50 off any Audio-Technica LP120XUSB & LP3 turntables and a sale on gift cards. Furthermore, those who spend more than $100 will be entered in a raffle for a chance to win a $100 gift card. Doors open at 8 am on Black Friday, but if you can't make it the store is also running promotions for Small Business Saturday.

Equally important to their weekend's sales, Omega Music is also hosting a coat drive. In order to help meet their goal of collecting 200 new or gently worn coats, they are incentivizing donations. Anyone who donates on Black Friday will get a chance to spin their prize wheel. The coat drive will last weekend and donations will go to Dayton's St. Vincent de Paul Society.
