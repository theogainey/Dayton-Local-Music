Around since 2008, [Me & Mountains](https://www.facebook.com/me.and.mountains) has long been a favorite of many Dayton music fans. Last month, on November 9th, the band released their first EP since releasing their 2016 album *Gold*. Titled *Dream Sequence, Vol 1*, this release has been highly welcomed by fans of the band. In addition to featuring great songs, listening to *Dream Sequence, Vol 1* is a great way to be introduced to the band's music.

For those new to Me & Mountains, there is no better way to introduce yourself to the band than by listening to this EP. For one thing, *Dream Sequence, Vol 1* features just 5 songs which makes it a quick listen. Furthermore, the EP does an excellent job of showing the listener what the band is all about. In short checking out Me & Mountains is well worth your time. Also, there is no better place to start than their latest EP.
