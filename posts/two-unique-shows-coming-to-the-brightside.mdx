Since opening in October of 2018, The Brightside Music and Event Venue hosted many unique acts. Located downtown on east 3rd street, The Brightside Music and Event Venue has already established itself as one of Dayton's top music venues. Booking shows featuring a wide variety of genres, The Brightside has brought a new flavor to Dayton's music scene. This weekend once again brings two shows to The Brightside that feature acts not like that usually seen in Dayton.

First up, at The Brightside Music and Event Venue, is an act unlike what is often seen in Dayton. Playing this Friday night, October 18th, is the visionary violinist, Dixon's Violin. Dixon's Violin has been seen on TED.com, at Electric Forest, at Burning Man, and all across North America. Improvising on a 5-string electric violin with a looping system developed to create an all-live one-man symphony this is a rare opportunity to see this mesmerizing musician up-close-and-personal.

Along with Dixion's Violin, Friday night also brings Dance Furiously to The Brightside. Dance Furiously is a rock and roll orchestration of funk, electronica, jazz, pop & soul that blends together a compelling sound that tells the story of a thriving music community in Columbus, Ohio. The group emphasizes live improvisation & expression through their live show and consistently opens up their songs and reinterprets them to make them sound uniquely new, each time.

Also, this weekend at The Brightside Music and Event Venue is the Grammy-winning jazz guitarist Bob Lanzetti. Bob Lanzetti is a Brooklyn, NY based guitarist, composer, producer, and educator. He has performed and recorded with many artists throughout the NYC area as well as played in over 40 countries with the three-time Grammy Award-Winning jazz/funk collective, Snarky Puppy. This must-see show will be at The Brightside this Sunday, October 20.
