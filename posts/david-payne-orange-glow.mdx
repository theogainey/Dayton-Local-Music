For those not familiar with [David Payne](https://www.facebook.com/davidpaynesongs/), he has long had an important presence in Dayton's music scene. Not only as a member of [The New Old-Fashioned](https://www.facebook.com/TheNewOldFashioned/) but also as a solo artist and other collaborations with many local musicians. After a few years since his last solo release, he has released his latest album, *Orange Glow*, on December 14th.

A thing that makes a musician's solo albums special is it allows a musician to explore sounds different than they would with their main band. In the case of *Orange Glow*, David Payne plays more intimate songs than you would find on a record by The New Old-Fashioned. In contrast to his usual role in The New Old-Fashioned, on this album, David Payne functions as a traditional singer-songwriter. Ultimately the album gives listeners a closer look into who he is as a songwriter.

If you are already a fan of David Payne's work, *Orange Glow* will further seal your love for his work. On the other hand, if you're not a fan yet the album will introduce you to one of Dayton's top songwriters. Either way, the album is another in a long line of great work from a great musician.
