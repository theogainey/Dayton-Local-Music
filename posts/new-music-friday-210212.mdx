First up on our list of new music released today by Dayton musicians is the latest single from [The Boxcar Suite](https://www.theboxcarsuite.com/), titled "Turndt Awn". In addition to being some of the greatest work to date by the band, this single also serves as a preview of the band's upcoming album *Every Side of the Abyss*. Among the many reasons to be excited about this single and the upcoming album is that this album features some of the last recording guitarist Tony Moore made with the band before moving out of the country. Currently "Turdnt Awn" is available on all major streaming services and can be purchased on The Boxcar Suite's [Bandcamp page](https://theboxcarsuite.bandcamp.com/track/turndt-awn).

Another Dayton area artist who released new music today is [Gabe Maas and the Bruins](https://www.facebook.com/Gmatbband). Today this newer Dayton area artist released his first single that was entirely self-written and produced. This new single, titled "Stranger" is a great example of this artist's style of pop music. After making it to the finals of last year's Battle of the Bands at The Brightside, it became clear to many that this area musician is someone to keep an eye on. If you haven't check out his music yet, you can find "Stranger" on [Spotify](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/gabemaasandthebruins/stranger?fbclid=IwAR0nl5D8JEdLAOUCWFWA8ec4btUoUBoTUCTaVS_qel4TSnr77h2G8rnbExQ) and other streaming services.
