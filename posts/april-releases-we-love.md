Although April may have been the first month in Dayton history without in-person live music, thankfully it didn't mean the music stopped. In addition to the countless live streams put on by Dayton area musicians, many also released some great new music. While not a complete list, here are a few April releases from Dayton area musicians that we love.

## Seth Gilliam - *Sweet Tea*

First on our list is the five-song EP, *Sweet Tea*, from [Seth Gilliam](https://sgfakenews.bandcamp.com/). This EP is Seth Gilliam's follow up to Seth Gilliam & The Fake News's full-length album *Misconstrued*. If you loved *Misconstrued* be sure to head on over to [Bandcamp](https://sgfakenews.bandcamp.com/album/sweet-tea) or you're favorite streaming service and check it out. You will not be disappointed.

## Zeb McNabb - *Three Screen Dream*

Next on our list is the full-length album *Three Screen Dream* from [Zeb McNabb](https://zebmcnabb.bandcamp.com/releases). There is a lot of good things we could say about this album but to sum it up after we were done listening we were bummed this was his only album because we wanted to listen to more. If that's not a sign of a good album we don't know what is. That being said be sure to head over to [Bandcamp](https://zebmcnabb.bandcamp.com/album/three-screen-dream) or Spotify and check it out.

## This Pine Box - "Would You Walk"

At this point in 2020, [This Pine Box](https://thispinebox.bandcamp.com/) already has had a very active year when it comes to releasing new music. In addition to kicking off their year by releasing the single "How We Roll" in January and two more singles already released the band is also planning a full-length album release sometime this fall. For their latest single, "Would You Walk", the band decided to release it in style by releasing the single on vinyl with “What Can I Say” as the single's B side. Overall, it's hard not to love this new single when you add in the fact you can own it on vinyl.
