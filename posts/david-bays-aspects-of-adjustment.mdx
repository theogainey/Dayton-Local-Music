After releasing his first EP in 2018, on April 12th, 2020 David Bays released his debut full-length album, *Aspects of Adjustment*. Given that he spent around three years writing the songs for this album, there is no doubt that this album represents a significant step for him as a musician. Additionally, the album is a very personal look at David Bays as a songwriter as Aspects of Adjustment is about David's transition to normal life after going through chemotherapy for two and a half years to cure a lymphoma diagnosis.

As a result of being about David Bay's transition back to normal life, many of the songs on the album are very personal to him. For example, the song "Another Chance to Breathe" is all about the people who were there for him during his treatment. While it was a difficult time, David finds himself lucky to have the people around him he did. In his words "I firmly believe people are the best medicine and that I would not be alive today without them".

Altogether *Aspects of Adjustment* not only introduces the listener to who David Bays is a musician but also sheds light on a time of his life that will forever impact his songwriting. Although a newcomer to Dayton's music scene, be sure to be on the lookout for more great music from him in the future.
